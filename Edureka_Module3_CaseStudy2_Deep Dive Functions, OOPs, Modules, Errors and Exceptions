                                                    Case Study Solution
Domain – Banking Marketing
focus – Optimization

Business challenge/requirement
Bank of Portugal runs marketing campaign to offer loans to clients. Loan is offered to only clients with particular professions. 
List of successful campaigns (with client data) is given in attached dataset. 
You have to come up with program which reads the file and builds a set of unique profession list and given input 
profession of client – system tells whether client is eligible to be approached for marketing campaign.

Key issues
Tele Caller can only make x number of cold calls in a day. Hence to increase her effectiveness only eligible customers 
should be called

Considerations
Current system does not differentiate clients based on age and profession

Data volume
447 records in bank-data.csv

Additional information
- NA

Business benefits
Company can achieve between 15% to 20% higher conversion by targeting right clients

Approach to Solve
You have to use fundamentals of Python taught in module 3
1. Read file bank-data.csv
2. Build a set of unique jobs
3. Read the input from command line –profession
4. Check if profession is in list
5. Print whether client is eligible

Enhancements for code
You can try these enhancements in code
1. Compute max and min age for loan eligibility based on data in csv file
2. Store max and min age in dictionary
3. Make the profession check case insensitive
4. Currently program ends after the check. Take the input in while loop and end only if user types "END" for profession

Solution

# Read the file in read only mode
campaign_data = open('bank-data.csv','r')
i = 0;
joblist = set() # empty set to store list of jobs

# Read the Data from file
for data in campaign_data:
  i += 1
  if i == 1 : # 1st Line is header skip it.
    continue

# Strip new line characters
data = data.rstrip('\n')

#print (" data is:" , data)
# Split the line on comma read the second word as it contains the job name

words = data.split(',')
joblist.add(words[1])

# close the file after reading
campaign_data.close()
print(" List of Jobs Eligible For Campaign:", joblist)

# Take input from TeleCaller to check eligibilty of Client
client_prof = input('Enter client profession: ')
if (client_prof in joblist):
  print ( "Go Ahead!!! and Make Some Sales !!!! Client is eligible for Tele Calling" )
else:
  print("Skip this one *** Client Needs to be in one of these jobs", joblist)
