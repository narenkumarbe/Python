                                                            Case Study Solution

Domain – Telecom
focus – Optimization

Business challenge/requirement
LifeTel Telecom is the latest entrant in the highly competitive Telecom market of Singapore. It issues SIM to the verified users. 
Till now verification was manual through the photocopy of approved id card document. 
However, government has recently introduced Social ID called Reference ID which is mapped to fingerprint of user. 
LifeTel should now verify user against the fingerprint and Reference ID

Key issues
Build a system where when user enters Reference ID it is encrypted, 
so that hackers cannot view the mapping of Reference ID and finger print

Considerations
System should be secure

Data volume
- NA
Additional information
- NA
Business benefits
Company will be able to quickly issue SIM to user and expected gain in volume is approximately 10 times as the manual process of 
verification is replaced with secure automated system

Approach to Solve
You have to use fundamentals of Python taught in module 2
1. Read the input from command line – Reference ID
2. Check for validity – it should be 12 digits and allows on number and alphabet
3. Encrypt the Reference ID and print it for reference

Enhancements for code
You can try these enhancements in code
1. Allow some special characters in ReferenceID
2. Give the option for decryption to user

Solution
import base64 # Used for encoding
# Take Input from user
reference_id = input ('Enter Reference ID: ')
if(len(reference_id) != 12):
  print("Reference ID should be 12 characters")
# list of characters allowed
allowed_chars = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ" + "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" + "0123456789"
is_validated = True
for c in reference_id:
  if (c not in allowed_chars):
    is_validated = False
    break
print("Is validated:", is_validated)

if(not is_validated) :
  print("Reference ID should contain only number and alphabets")

# Encrypt the Reference ID:
reference_id_encrypt = base64.b64encode(reference_id.encode())
print(" Congratulations!!! ReferenceID is encrypted, You are Safe from Hackers:",reference_id_encrypt )
